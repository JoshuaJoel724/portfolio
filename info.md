Hi, I'm Joshua Joel ‚Äî a passionate Mechanical Engineering student and emerging 3D printing innovator.

Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering, I specialize in CAD design, product development, and additive manufacturing. My work blends creativity and precision ‚Äî whether I'm modeling a 6-DOF robotic arm in CATIA or turning recycled plastic bottles into functional 3D printer filament.

I love designing real-world solutions, especially in sustainable manufacturing and DIY engineering systems. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve worked on projects involving mechanical simulation, IoT integration, and rapid prototyping.

I‚Äôve earned recognition through awards at IIT Dharwad and Reva University, and I‚Äôve completed an internship at CSIR-NAL, where I explored aerospace composites.

My tools of choice include Fusion 360, CATIA, ANSYS, and Arduino, and I‚Äôm constantly learning through NPTEL and hands-on experiments.

 Gyroscopic Anti-Gravity Cup Holder

Tagline: A tiltable stand that keeps the cup upright ‚Äî always.

Description:
Designed and 3D printed a gyroscopic-style cup holder that stays level even when tilted in different directions. The concept uses a passive gimbal mechanism to simulate anti-gravity behavior. It was created as a demonstration model for stability and balance.

Tools Used:
Fusion 360, Anycubic Kobra Neo, PLA

Key Highlights:

Designed in Fusion 360 with moving parts that print in one go

Printed without support material using clever joint design

Fully 3D printed in a single print ‚Äì no assembly required

Presented at IIT Dharwad and won 3rd Prize in Product Design


What I Learned:

Gyroscopic and gimbal-based stability

Support-free mechanical design for 3D printing

Simplifying complex movement into a single-part model
